        <!-- JOSE'S CHOICES -->
        <!-- First set of Choices -->
        <div id="questionOne">
            <p>You're in the middle of a zombie apocalypse, you have two choices to either go inside a hotel to take shelter in or keep walking down the street</p>
            <div id="buttons">
                <button id="leftBtn">Take Shelter</button>
                <button id="rightBtn">Keep going</button>
            </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Second set of Choices -->
        <div id="questionTwo">
            <p>You enter the hotel. To your left there is a bat that can be used to defend yourself. Will you take the bat?</p>
            <div id="buttons">
                <button id="leftBtn2">Leave Bat</button>
                <button id="rightBtn2">Take Bat</button>
            </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Third set of Choices -->
        <div id="questionThree">
            <p>You picked up the bat. As you explore the hotel trying to find a way to the roof, you come across a person who is facing the opposite direction from you.</p> 
            <p>Behind it seems to be a door that would obviously lead to the roof. Will you go up to it to make sure it is someone sane or take the risk and smack the living hell out of it? </p>
            <div id="buttons">
                <button id="leftBtn3">Go up to it</button>
                <button id="rightBtn3">Smack it</button>
            </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Fifth set of Choices -->
        <div id="questionFour">
            <p>You smack the living doodoo out of it. It happened to be a zombie blocking the door leading to the roof.</p>
            <p>You go through the door, from up here you can see the whole town infested with zombies. You have a better chance of survival if you continue traveling from roof to roof.</p>
            <p>Will you parkour from roof to roof or safely cross.</p>
            <div id="buttons">
                <button id="leftBtn4">Cross Safely</button>
                <button id="rightBtn4">Parkour</button>
            </div>
        </div>


        <!-- JONATHAN'S CHOICES -->
        <!-- Seventh set of Choices -->
        <div id="questionFive">
            <p>While you are crossing from roof to roof, there is a door that takes you down to the first floor to leave the building. Or would you wait for a random helicopter to come rescue you?</p>
            <div id="buttons">
                <button id="leftBtn5">Leave the building</button>
                <button id="rightBtn5">Wait for helicopter</button>

        </div>

        <!-- Eight set of Choices -->
        <div id="questionSix">
            <p>You decided to wait for a random helicopter. All of a sudden, a helicopter is actually coming to rescue you but a group of zombies are heading to the roof you are on.</p>
            <p>Would you get on the helicopter or fight the zombies?</p>
            <div id="buttons">
                <button id="leftBtn6">Get in helicopter</button>
                <button id="rightBtn6">Fight the zombies</button>
            </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Ninth set of Choices -->
        <div id="questionSeven">
            <p>When you get on the helicopter, a lot of zombies grab onto the helicopter. The helicopter gets heavier. There is a flamethrower and a machine gun on the side of the seats.</p>
            <p>Will you kill the zombies with a machine gun or a flamethrower?</p>
            <div id="buttons">
                <button id="leftBtn7">Flamethrower</button>
                <button id="rightBtn7">Machine Gun</button>

        <!-- Last set of Choices -->
        <div id="questionEight">
            <p>A zombie jumps on to the helicopter and grabs the Co-pilot's leg. Would you save him or stay inside?</p>
            <div id="buttons">
                <button id="leftBtn8">Save Co-pilot</button>
                <button id="rightBtn8">Stay inside</button>

        </div>

        <!-- ENDING -->
        <div id="ending">
            <p>You decide to stay in the helicopter and flee the area. As soon as the helicopter started to move away the roof it did not take too long for it to crash and fall on a road killing the pilot.</p>
            <p>You land in the middle of the street. You have two choices to either go to the hotel down the block or keep walking down the street...</p>

        <!-- JOSE'S DEATH OUTCOMES -->
        <!-- Outcomes of choices that leads the user dying -->
        <div id="deathOne">
            <p>You continued to walk down, you encounter a group of zombies heading your way. You kick a pebble towards them which gets their attention and become aggressive. You get killed. </p>

        <div id="deathTwo">
            <p>You leave the bat behind and continue exploring the hotel. You encounter a zombie who is running towards you. You regret not picking up the bat and ended up dying.</p>

        <div id="deathThree">
            <p>You decided to make sure if it's someone who is not infected. Before you even put your hand on it's shoulder, it quickly turns around and lunges at you.</p>

        </div>

        <div id="deathFour">
            <p>You tried parkouring, you did a really bad jump and ended up falling off the hotel's roof, probably broke a bone or two. As you lay there suffering for acting stupid in the middle of a zombie apocalypse, the noise you made when you fell alerted zombies nearby which then came up to you and killed you.</p>

        <!-- JONATHAN'S DEATH OUTCOMES -->
        <div id="deathFive">
            <p>There are a lot of zombies outside the building. It's better to stay and home for a random helicopter to come rescue you.</p>
            <img src="img/youdied-logo.png">
            <p class="retry"><a href="index.html">Click here to try again</a></p>
        </div>

        <div id="deathSix">
            <p>Fighting the zombies would get you killed. You can't kill them all if you are alone and with just a bat.</p>

            <p class="retry"><a href="index.html">Click here to try again</a></p>
        </div>

        <div id="deathSeven">
            <p>Using the flamethrower would make the zombies die slowly since it wont be a direct impact. Also the helicopter will come crashing down due to all the zombies on it.</p>

        <div id="deathEight">
            <p>It would be too late to help the Co-pilot because he will fall off the helicopter before you even try rescuing him. You don't even know him either.</p>
            <p>Anyways, you try reaching for his arm while he's falling and fall down with him.</p>

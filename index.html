            <p>You're in the middle of a zombie apocalypse, you have two choices to either go inside a hotel to take shelter in or keep walking down the street</p>
            <div id="buttons">

        <div id="questionThree">
            <p>You pick up the bat ready to use it against anything that came in your way. As you explore the hotel, you come across a person with long hair facing the opposite direction from you that leads to some stairs going up. Will you go up to it to make sure it is someone sane or take the risk and smack the living hell out of it? </p>
            <div id="buttons">

            <p>You started to remove the debris little by little. Everything was going well until a ton of more debris fell on you and you faint. You regain consciousness and find out you can't move your legs. You look at your legs and noticed that you're stuck and can't get out. You ended up dying being stuck there for days. </p>

        <div id="deathFive">
            <p>You tried parkouring, you did a really bad jump and ended up falling off the hotel's roof, probably broke a bone or two. As you lay there suffering for acting stupid in the middle of a zombie apocalypse, the noise you made when you fell alerted zombies nearby which then came up to you and killed you.</p>
